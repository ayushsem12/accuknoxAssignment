Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller.
 This means that if a signal handler modifies the database and the caller's transaction
is rolled back, any changes made in the signal handler will also be rolled back.

1.models.py:::

from django.db import models, transaction
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
import threading

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    processed = models.BooleanField(default=False)

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_receiver(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal executed in thread: {threading.get_ident()}")
    instance.processed = True
    instance.save()
    print(f"Signal: Instance {instance.id} processed field set to {instance.processed}")

2.In the Django shell or a view:

from myapp.models import MyModel
from django.db import transaction

try:
    with transaction.atomic():
        instance = MyModel.objects.create(name="Test")
        print(f"Caller: Created instance {instance.id}")
        
        raise Exception("Forcing a rollback")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Transaction failed: {e}")

print(f"Processed value after transaction: {MyModel.objects.get(id=instance.id).processed}")
