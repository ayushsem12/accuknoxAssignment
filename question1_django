By default, Django signals are executed synchronously.It means that the signal handlers
are executed in the same thread and process as the code that triggered the signal, 
without any asynchronous behavior unless explicitly programmed.

#Code:

import time
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def my_handler(sender, **kwargs):
    print("Signal received. Starting handler...")
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulate a long-running task
    print("Handler finished.")

user = User(username='testuser')
user.save()
print("User save complete.")
